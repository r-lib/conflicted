\title{conflicted: An Alternative Conflict Resolution Strategy}
\description{
R's default conflict management system gives the most recently loaded package precedence. This can make it hard to detect conflicts, particularly when they arise because a package update creates ambiguity that did not previously exist. 'conflicted' takes a different approach, making every conflict an error and forcing you to choose which function to use.

\section{Resolving conflicts}{


To permanently resolve a conflict within a session, use assignment:

\preformatted{
library(conflicted)
library(dplyr)

filter <- dplyr::filter
}
}
