Description: R's default conflict management system gives the most recently
    loaded package precedence. This can make it hard to detect conflicts, 
    particularly when they arise because a package update creates ambiguity
    that did not previously exist. 'conflicted' takes a different approach, 
    making every conflict an error and forcing you to choose which function 
    to use.
