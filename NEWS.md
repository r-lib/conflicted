# conflicted (development version)

* conflicted now understands `include.only` and `exclude` arguments that 
  you might have specified in `library()` (#84).

* `conflict_prefer_all()` and `conflict_prefer_matching()` are now much faster.
  And when `losers` is supplied, they only register the minimal necessary
  number of conflicts.

* New `conflicts_prefer()` to easily declare multiple preferences at once:
  `conflicts_prefer(dplyr::filter, lubridate::week, ...)` (#82).

* Conflict dismabiguation message now provides clickable preferences (#74).

# conflicted 1.1.0

* New `conflicted_prefer_all()` and `conflicted_prefer_matching()` to
  prefer functions en masse (#51).

* Improvements to conflict detection and resolution:

  * Reports conflicts involving lazy loaded datasets (#54).
  
  * Don't report conflicts involving a `standardGeneric` (#47).
  
  * Better handling of conflicts cleared by superset principle: if there is
    a conflict all functions (including any base functions) are reported, and
    if there isn't a conflict, no packages are reported (instead of 1) (#47).
  
  * Don't report conflict between a function and a non-function (#30).

  * Conflicts involving a primitive function no longer error 
    (@nerskin, #46, #48).

# conflicted 1.0.4

* Fixes for dev rlang

# conflicted 1.0.3

* Fix > vs >= mistake

# conflicted 1.0.2

* Align with changes to R 3.6

# conflicted 1.0.1

* Internal `has_moved()` function no longer fails when it encounters a 
  call to `.Deprecated()` with no arguments (#29).

* `.conflicts` environment is correctly removed and replaced each time
  a new package is loaded (#28).

# conflicted 1.0.0

### New functions

* `conflict_scout()` reports all conflicts found with a set of packages.

* `conflict_prefer()` allows you to declare a persistent preference 
  (within a session) for one function over another (#4).

### Improve conflict resolution

*   conflicts now generally expects packages that override functions in base 
    packages to obey the "superset principle", i.e. that `foo::bar(...)` must 
    return the same value of `base::bar(...)` whenever the input is not an 
    error. In other words, if you override a base function you can only extend 
    the API, not change or reduce it.
    
    There are two exceptions. If the arguments of the two functions are not
    compatible (i.e. the function in the package doesn't include all 
    arguments of the base package), conflicts can tell it doesn't follow
    the superset principle. Additionally, `dplyr::lag()` fails to follow
    the superset principle, and is marked as a special case (#2).

* Functions that have moved between packages (i.e. functions with a call to 
  `.Deprecated("pkg::foo")`) as the first element of the function body) will 
  never generate conflicts.

* conflicted now listens for `detach()` events and removes conflicts that
  are removed by detaching a package (#5)

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Error messages for infix functions and non-syntactic function names are
  improved (#14)
